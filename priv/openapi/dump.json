You can attach\nto the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers\nthat have been detached.\n\nEither the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint\nto do anything.\n\nSee the [documentation for the `docker attach` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/)\nfor more details.\n\n### Hijacking\n\nThis endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`,\nand `stderr` on the same socket.\n\nThis is the response from the daemon for an attach request:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream\n\n[STREAM]\n```\n\nAfter the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used\nfor raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.\n\nTo hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client\ncan also optionally send connection upgrade headers.\n\nFor example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:\n\n```\nPOST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1\nUpgrade: tcp\nConnection: Upgrade\n```\n\nThe Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will\nsimilarly follow with the raw stream:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED\nContent-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream\nConnection: Upgrade\nUpgrade: tcp\n\n[STREAM]\n```\n\n### Stream format\n\nWhen the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),\nthe HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream\nand the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out\n`stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each\ncontaining a header and a payload.\n\nThe header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or\n`stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in\nthe last four bytes (`uint32`).\n\nIt is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:\n\n```go\nheader := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}\n```\n\n`STREAM_TYPE` can be:\n\n- 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)\n- 1: `stdout`\n- 2: `stderr`\n\n`SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size\nencoded as big endian.\n\nFollowing the header is the payload, which is the specified number of\nbytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:\n\n1. Read 8 bytes.\n2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.\n3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.\n4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.\n5. Goto 1.\n\n### Stream format when using a TTY\n\nWhen the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),\nthe stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked\nconnection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's\n`stdin`.\n"}},"/images/{name}/tag":{"post":{"tags":["Image"],"summary":"Tag an image","responses":{"500":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ErrorResponse"},"description":"Server error"},"409":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ErrorResponse"},"description":"Conflict"},"404":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ErrorResponse"},"description":"No such image"},"400":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ErrorResponse"},"description":"Bad parameter"},"201":{"description":"No error"}},"parameters":[{"type":"string","required":true,"name":"name","in":"path","description":"Image name or ID to tag."},{"type":"string","name":"repo","in":"query","description":"The repository to tag in.

It is the API the\nDocker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker\nclient can do can be done with the API.\n\nMost of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps`\nis `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers,\nwhich consists of several API calls.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following\nformat:\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"page not found\"\n}\n```\n\n# Versioning\n\nThe API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to\nensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API,\nyou prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use\nthe v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in\nthe URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message\nis returned.\n\nIf you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.43) is used.\nFor example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.43/info`. Using the\nAPI without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\nEngine releases in the near future should support this version of the API,\nso your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.\n\nThe API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties\nto responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and\nrequest body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional\nproperties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer\ndaemons.\n\n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send\nauthentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with\nregistries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as\n`X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)\n(JSON) string with the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"username\": \"string\",\n  \"password\": \"string\",\n  \"email\": \"string\",\n  \"serveraddress\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this\nstructure, double quotes are required.\n\nIf you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth),\nyou can just pass this instead of credentials:\n\n```\n{\n  \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\"\n}\n```\n"},"definitions":{"ClusterVolumeSpec":{"type":"object","properties":{"Group":{"type":"string","description":"Group defines the volume group of this volume.
